## Brief background
I was born in Nairobi, Kenya in a big family of 8 kids. My parents always worked hard for us to have a better life, which gave me the morals of hard work and not giving up when things get tough. As I was growing up I was always fascinated with airplanes. It was in high school, junior year, when we were taught about airplanes and how they fly, their forces and how they are designed. After this, I always wanted to be an Aeronautical Engineer and I began looking at the best places to study it. However, my country did not offer any degrees in this field. My passion brought me to Western Michigan University, which had a transfer program with Egerton University. Below is a summary of my work experience, education and some of my short to long term goals.

I now work as a Tooling Simulation Engineer at Tesla in Grand Rapids, Michigan. My main responsibilities are to ensure that the products from the designers are feasible by running simulations to ensure their mabnifacturability. This is a position that requires good and constant communication with other teams such as the product designers, process, die designers, and tryout die makers. It also requires good CAD skills in order to be able to design dies in CATIA or turn countermeasures into reality in order to be proven if feasible.

On my free time I like to spend my time with family, reading and getting involved with investing in the stock market and learning more about Machine Learning technologies. This is what brought me to the point of writing this blog. My main goal with this blog is to have discussioons with both experts and new individuals to the field of Machine Learning. Bringing together individuals to discuss Machine Learning would be the best outcome from this blog.
