Birds inspored us to fly, burdock plants inspired velcro, and nature has inspired many other inventions. It seems logical, then ,to look at the brains's architecture for inspiration on how to build an intelligent machine. Neural networks were created to try and mimic the most intelligent machine, the brain. Artificial Neural Networks are versatile, powerful and scalable making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex Machine Learning tasks, suchas classifying billions of images e.g. Google images, powering speech recognition services e.g. Apple's siri, recommending the best videos to watch to hundreds  ot users everyday, e,g. Youtuce, NEtflis, or learning to beat the world champion at the game of Go by examining millions of past game and playing against itself (Deepmeind's AlphaGo).
