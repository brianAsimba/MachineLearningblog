## Matrices and Vectors:
Matrices and vectors are arrays that are used to express any kinds of data processing tasks concisely that might otherwise require writing loops. Practice of replacing loops with matrices an vectors is referred to as vectorization. Vectorization will often be one or more orders of magnitude faster than their pure equivalents using loops. One of the powerful methods that makes vectorization very effective is broadcasting, which we will discuss about later on. First, let us start with some matrix naming:

\begin{bmatrix}
 2&  3&  2& \\ 
 &  &  & \\ 
 &  &  & 
\end{bmatrix}
