This is an example of Neural Networks matha and how backpropagation is done. In this example I will be going theough the math of the forward and backpropagation. After completing the math, I will write code to calculate the same. This will be be particularly be helpful for beginners as they can understand what goes on behind the scenes, especially in backpropagation. I will add links to these math derivations on where to dig deeper or videos to watch to understand better what I am doing.
