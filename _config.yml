bio:                'I am a graduate of Western Michigan University with a Bachelors in Aeronautical Engineering. 
                     I currently work at Tesla as a Tooling Simulation Engineer. On my time away from work, 
                     I like reading on Engineering, stocks, investments, playing soccer and now learning Machine 
                     and applying Machine Learning. I first hear of Machine Learning back in 2017, but I did not 
                     really start to get serious until last year when I was talking to my friend at Tesla who was 
                     playing around with Neural Networks. I started a group in Tesla and I have taken a Machine 
                     Learning certificate course from Stanford University in order to better grasp the concepts. 
                     I started this blog to help others that are interested in the hot topic of Machine Learning, 
                     and want to dig in to the nitty gritty or just want to learn more but do not know where to 
                     begin. At first it, will be a lot of reading, then we will dive into code that I wrote 
                     while following Andrew Ng Machine Learning Coursera course. There is a saying, if you 
                     cannot explain it simple enough to someone who does not know it, then you did not 
                     understand it. This is one more reason I am doing this blog. I have gone through a 
                     lot of blogs, but none of it goes from introduction to coding complex Reinforcement 
                     learning systems. 
                     I am excited for the future use cases of Machine Learning algorithms.
